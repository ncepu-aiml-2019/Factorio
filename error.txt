! [rejected] master -> master (fetch first) error: failed to push some refs to 'address' 
hint: Updates were rejected because the remote contains work that you do
hint: not have locally. This is usually caused by another repository pushing
hint: to the same ref. You may want to first integrate the remote changes hint: (e.g., 'git pull ...') before pushing again.
hint: See the 'Note about fast-forwards' in 'git push --help' for details.

错误原因：本地库和GitHub中的库不同步
解决方法：
$ git pull --rebase origin master
$ git push origin master
